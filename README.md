Who is most likely to win MVP for this season of the NBA? Every basketball fan and basketball junkie dips their toes into this national conversation. People choose to root for their favorite player to win MVP. People choose to root for the player who is averaging the most points and is the best offensive player. People choose to root for the player who is the best highlight reel. NBA fans have their own opinions and arguments when it comes to this popular question. The best way to figure out this mostly asked question is by creating a code than can take old statistics of players that won MVP in the past and use those statistics to compare them with current statistics of players. This will allow a statistical prediction of who the current MVP front runner is and who is behind them. Our plan is to collect statistical data on former and current players who have won the MVP award and who have been in the race for the MVP award. We will then use that information to compare and contrast statistics of current players and determine who the frontrunners to win MVP are.
